worst case power output of NCH8200HV:
170V*0.005A = 0.85 Watts. 
Assume 80% efficiency -> input current of 210mA at 5V

PIC: 1-10mA

K155ID1: 25mA max

might need 22uf capacitor across pic rails to prevent reset on battery enable

on batt:
74lvc1g04: 16pf*16MHz * 3.3V = 0.845mA  
74lvc2g80: 22pF*16MHz*3.3V*(1+.5+.25) = 2.03mA
16F54: RA outputs consume 510uA, RB outputs consume 3.3V/10*5 mA , processor consumes ~250uA = 2.41mA
TCXO: 1.5mA

80mAh/(1.5+2.41+2.03+.845)mA= 11.7hours worst case.
