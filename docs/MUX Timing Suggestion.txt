MUX Timing Suggestion from ThreeNeurons:

If you multiplex a nixie, you need to add blanking intervals, to avoid ghosting. Ghosting is one tubes data interfering, visually, with its neighbor. Typical blanking intervals, for nixies, are between 100 to 300uS. Blanking is done, by turning ALL anodes OFF.  In normal multiplexing operation, the intended digit is turned ON, by lowering its cathode to zero volts, during the blanking interval. Only one cathode ON, at any time. At the end of the blanking interval, the intended anode is turned ON. It should be ON for a display interval between 1mS to 4mS (0.001 to 0.004 sec) .  A typical multiplexed frame is: B-H10-B-H1-B-M10-B-M1-B-H10… This is an example of a 4 digit clock display, with B=blanking interval, and H10=10-hours digit, and so on (M10=10 minutes, M1=1 minutes). The total frame time should be less than 20mS, to avoid flickering.

DO NOT blank, by turning all cathodes OFF. Especially, when using cathode drivers like a 74141 (or its Russian equivalent). If you attempt this with these devices, they will see over ~100V, and will conduct thru more than one cathode at a time. This will look similar to ghosting.  These devices are leaky, so at least one cathode should be ON at all times.

Turn-ON time decreases as supply voltage increases. Use a higher supply voltage when possible. Just because the specs say 170V, doesn’t mean you need to use 170V. This is a minimum value, to ensure striking. Remember that anode resistor. Its REQUIRED ! When a nixie turns ON, the voltage drops to its sustain level (130V to 150V). The difference  (Supply – Sustain) is dropped across that anode resistor. That sets the operating current. Use a supply of at least 180V. 190V to 210V is even better, if its a multiplexed circuit.
